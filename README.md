# merge_arrays
This is the code for the WA controls required challenge. I did use chatgpt for my errors and certain explanations that werent clear on the manual, but i wrote the code myself, with the help of the manual and google. THis code subscribes to 2 Int31MultiArrays topic /input/array1 and /input/array2. It then merges, sorts and publishes them
